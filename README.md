## What social problem is being addressed? 
> We are planning to investigate accessibility to clean water in Skid Row (a neighborhood in downtown Los Angeles). Clean water access can be heavily restricted when urban planning fails to take into account where clean water is needed and how to avoid contamination during distribution, which disporportionality impacts low-income housing families.

## Who is being empowered by your mapplication? 
> Our mapplication aims to empower minority populations (as stated in the article above, Skid Row is a predominantly Black community) as well as individuals facing poverty and/or homelessness within the neighborhood of Skid Row by giving people a place to voice their experiences with getting clean water via surveys. Not only is clean water an essential resource for every individual, but it is also critical in ensuring public health standards for the entire community.

## What technical and ethical problems could there be in developing this tool?
> Some technical problems include: 
> - Filtering out any identifying/sensitive information for safe publication online. 
> - Allowing auto-updates so that new information received from the community can be immediately displayed on the webapp without excessive overhead (i.e., site creators don't only batch update periodically). 

> Some ethical problems include: 
> - Ensuring informed consent by giving participants, within the survey, accurate information about the context of our mapplication and how data will be used. 
> - Making sure to not project our own biases on to respondents when creating survey questions and allowing individuals to freely express their own experiences.
