## What social problem is being addressed? 
> We are planning to investigate how accessible clean and reliable water fountains are for student athletes (grades 9-12) at Newbury Park High School (NPHS), a public high school in Newbury Park, CA that relies on just three outdated water fountains. For student atheletes who spend long hours at school, access to clean and reliable water sources is essential for their physical well-being and comfort. As this matter speaks to the health, performance, and daily experience of student athletes, it is important that they have a platform to voice their honest opinions and concerns.
>
> We plan to collaborate with the NPHS Key Club, a student-led organization that engages in community service projects, to meet with student athletes and gather their insights about water fountain conditions at NPHS using a short survey. We also hope to give our mapplication to the NPHS Key Club so they can continue to empower current and future student athletes. The NPHS Key Club can also work with the school's PTSA to further increase awareness about this issue by involving families and other local community members.

## Who is being empowered by your mapplication? 
> Our mapplication aims to empower student athletes in grades 9-12 at NPHS who are often excluded from school board meeting and other administrative spaces that discuss water fountain conditions. Through this platform, we hope student athletes and the general student body at NPHS can take a more active role in understanding and addressing campus issues that concern them. 

## What technical and ethical problems could there be in developing this tool?
> Some technical problems include: 
> - Filtering out any identifying/sensitive information for safe publication online. 
> - Allowing auto-updates so that new survey responses can be immediately displayed on the map without excessive overhead (i.e., site creators don't only batch update periodically). 

> Some ethical problems include: 
> - Ensuring informed consent, especially for minors among our student participants, by providing accurate information in our survey about the mapplication's context and how data will be used. 
> - Making sure to not project our own biases on to respondents when creating survey questions and allowing individuals to freely express their own experiences.
