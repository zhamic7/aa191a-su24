## How To Use This Mapplication
> This mapplications aims to investigate how accessible clean and reliable water fountains are for student athletes in grades 9-12 at Newbury Park High School (NPHS), a public high school in Newbury Park, CA that relies on just three outdated water fountains. For student athletes who spend long hours at school, access to clean and reliable water sources is essential for their physical well-being and comfort, but their voices are often excluded from school board meetings and other administrative spaces that discuss infrastructure issues like water fountain conditions. As a result, we hope to work with the NPHS Key Club and school's PTSA so this mapplication can become a collaborative platform for student athletes as well as the general student body at NPHS to voice their honest opinions and concerns in order to take a more active role in understanding and addressing campus issues that concern them. Student athletes at NPHS can anonymously share their experiences through the survey published on this site. Survey responses are automatically added to and displayed on a map of NPHS for ease of visualization.
