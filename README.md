# Newbury Park Student Athletes' H2Opinions 
> An online mapplication that aims to provide student athletes at Newbury Park High School (NPHS) a platform to share their experiences with water fountain conditions on campus. Community members can use the different tools on the website to learn about this communityâ€™s opinions on this matter. Check it out [here](https://zhamic7.github.io/aa191a-su24/)!

## Objective
By providing a platform with a survey and a mapplication, we hope to investigate how accessible clean and reliable water fountains are for student athletes (grades 9-12) at Newbury Park High School (NPHS), a public high school in Newbury Park, CA that relies on just three outdated water fountains. For student athletes who spend long hours at school, access to clean and reliable water sources is essential for their physical well-being and comfort, but their voices are often excluded from school board meetings and other administrative spaces that discuss infrastructure issues like water fountain conditions. Student athletes at NPHS can anonymously share their experiences through the survey published on this site, and survey responses will be automatically added to and displayed on a map of NPHS.<br>

We will give ownership of the website to the NPHS Key Club, a student-led organization that engages in community service projects, so they can continue to meet with student athletes and gather their insights about water fountain conditions at NPHS. The NPHS Key Club can also work with the school's PTSA to further increase awareness about this issue by involving families and other local community members.

## Who is being empowered?

Our mapplication aims to empower student athletes in grades 9-12 at NPHS who, although most familiar with and dependent on clean water sources on campus, are often excluded from school board meetings and other administrative spaces that discuss infrastructure issues like water fountain conditions. Through this platform, we hope student athletes and the general student body at NPHS can take a more active role in understanding and addressing campus issues that concern them.

## Technology Stack
*Frontend*: MapLibre GL JS, Javascript, HTML/CSS<br>
*Backend*: Google Spreadsheets, Google Apps Script, PapaParse<br>

*Survey*: Google Forms<br>

## How can it be repurposed?

For student athletes who spend long hours at school, access to clean and reliable water sources is essential for their physical well-being and comfort. As this matter speaks to the health, performance, and daily experience of student athletes, it is important that they have a platform to voice their honest opinions and concerns. While our current mapplication is for student athletes at NPHS to voice their experiences with clean water access, this project can also serve as a prototype for student groups at other public high schools. Student-led service organizations at all public high schools that are concerned about water fountain conditions, or even other infrastructure issues (e.g., restrooms) and on-campus resources (e.g., internet access), can repurpose this project to amplify the voices of the impacted student communities.
